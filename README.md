Just a small private Project to get my feet into coding
This is a small software which lets you just builds a small Raiding Group for Final Fantasy 14. While it isn't anything spectacular and still in a pretty bad shape, it should kinda do what its supposed to do.
WHile I would gladly show how it works, I unfortunatly couldn't make a runable JAR file as I need to get the correct JDK version to work. But if you have an IDE that supports Java feel free to run the app via the Main.java file.
